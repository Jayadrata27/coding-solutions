# Sorted Insert Position

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a sorted array  **arr[]** (0-index based) of distinct integers and an integer  **k**, find the index of k if it is present in the arr[]. If not, return the index where k should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 6], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 5 is found at index 2 as arr[2] = 5, the output is 2.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 6], k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The element 2 is not present in the array, but inserting it at index 1 will maintain the sorted order.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 7, 10, 14], k = 15
Output: 5
Explanation: The element 15 is not present in the array, but inserting it after index 4 will maintain the sorted order.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int searchInsertK(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int n=arr.size();
        int start=0,end=n-1;
        int index=n;
        
        while(start<=end){
            int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
            
            if(arr[mid]==k){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(arr[mid]<k){
                start=mid+1;
            }
            else{
                index=mid;
                end=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
};
```
